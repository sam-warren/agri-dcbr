# Dog and Cat Breeder Registration System (DCBR)

The purpose of the Dog and Cat Breeder Registration System (DCBR) is to act as one of the pillars of the Dog and Cat Breeder Regulatory Framework (DCBF) to target irresponsible dog and cat breeders and sellers (operators). The DCBR will provide a system wherein a person must register in order to be in compliance with the law and legally able to undertake the regulated activity of breeding and/or selling cats and dogs and their offspring.

As the industry is unregulated and for the most part unknown the DCBR will serve several purposes:

  1. Provide the tool for operators to easily register their operation to enable them to take part in the regulated activity;

  2. Collect important industry related data such as identity, number and location of operators and related inspections (paramount to make evidence-based policy in the future);

  3. Communicate important documents (provincial minimum Standards of Care regulation) and educational documents with operators;

  4. DCBR owned by government but with ability to be operated by potential designated agency; and

  5. Provide important operational status information to consumers including a registration number that consumers will learn to ask for in making purchases.
